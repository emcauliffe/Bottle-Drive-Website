        <h2 id="q3">Q: Why do you not collect cans?</h2>
        <p>A: First off, for sanitary reasons, since people drink directly out of cans. Secondly, the return process is
            much more favourable to glass bottles, so in order to run our collection as efficiently as possible, we do
            not accept cans of any sort. </p>
        <h2 id="q4">Q: Where should I put my bottles?</h2>
        <p>A: Please place your bottles on your front porch, driveway or curb. Anywhere where they can easily be picked
            up and carried back to a car. You can write a message when signing up specifying where the bottles will be
            left. However, please avoid leaving empties behind a gate or fence, inside a garage, etc. </p>
        <h2 id="q5">Q: What days are you collecting?</h2>
        <p>A: Any available pick-up day will be visible to choose in the drop-down section &quot;Pick-up Date&quot;
            after
            you have input your address.</p>
        <h2 id="q6">Q: What time should I put my bottles out?</h2>
        <p>A: Please have your bottles out by the times listed below. If there are multiple pickup times, please put them out for the earliest timeslot (ex. drive has pickups in afternoons and evenings → have bottles out by noon).</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Morning pickups:</td>
                <td>07:00 (7 a.m.)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Afternoon pickups:</td>
                <td>12:00 (noon)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Evening pickups:</td>
                <td>17:00 (5 p.m.)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2 id="q7">Q: What if my bottles haven&#39;t been picked up yet?
        </h2>
        <p>A: If you have signed up for a pick-up date and your bottles have not been collected by the end of the day,
            please contact us through email, and we will do our best to sort it out. </p>
