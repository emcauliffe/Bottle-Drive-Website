        <h1 id="faq">FAQ:</h1>
        <p>We will try and answer common questions here, if you have any other questions, please send us an email at <a
                href="mailto:mail@bottlesagainstcovid.org">mail@bottlesagainstcovid.org</a></p>
        <h2 id="q1">Q: What do you accept on pick-up day?</h2>
        <p>A: We will only collect </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>empty wine and spirit bottles in boxes</strong> </li>
            <li><strong>glass beer bottles in their original 24/28 pack container</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>this means <strong><em>no cans</em></strong> ... sorry :( </p>
        <h2 id="q2">Q: Why do you not collect cans?</h2>
        <p>A: First off, for sanitary reasons, since people drink directly out of cans. Secondly, the return process is
            much
            more favourable to glass bottles, so in order to run our collection as efficiently as possible, we do not
            accept
            cans of any sort. </p>
        <h2 id="q3">Q: Where should I put my bottles?</h2>
        <p>A: Please place your bottles on your front porch, driveway or curb. Anywhere where they can easily be picked
            up and carried back to a car. You can write a message when signing up specifying where the bottles will be left.</p>
        <h2 id="q4">Q: What days are you collecting?</h2>
        <p>A: Any available pick-up day will be visible to choose in the drop-down section &quot;Pick-up Date&quot;
            after
            you have input your address. </p>
        <h2 id="q5">Q: What if my bottles haven&#39;t been picked up yet?
        </h2>
        <p>A: If you had signed up for a pick-up date and your bottles have not been collected by the end of the day,
            please
            contact us through email, and we will do our best to sort it out. </p>
